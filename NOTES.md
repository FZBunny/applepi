#### A short list of shortcomings and known bugs

- The 'help' files are incomplete, and out-of-date.  Updates coming soon.
- When the 'Apple //e enhanced' ROM is selected, applepi will not boot from a hard drive or 800KiB floppy in slot 7 drive 1.   Instead, it will skip slot 7 and boot from slot 6.  Under investigation.  Workarounds: A) Boot from slot 6 and use: ```PR#7``` -or- B) Select the 'Apple //e' ROM instead)
- Applepi does not always play well with the later versions of ProDOS utility disks.  The utility programs will often ignore both "HD" drives. Under investigation. Nearest thing to a workaround is to use ProDOS 1.0 utilities.
- There are four mildly annoying horizontal lines in "Small Screen" mode. Under investigation.  Workaround: Use the "Big Screen" mode if your display will permit.
