<BR>

Printing is accomplished by use of the <b>PR#1</b> command.

<p style="margin-left: 0px">
<b>Case 1:</b> The '<b>Print to File</b>' menu is not in effect:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px">
  By default, text output will be directed from the screen to the terminal from which ApplePi has been executed.&nbsp;
(If ApplePi was not executed from a terminal, text is simply sent into the aether, gone forever.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px">
<b>Case 2: 'Print Text</b>' was used:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px">
  Text will be written to the selected file.&nbsp; Every byte will be flushed to disk as it is encountered, so the '<b>Close Printer</b>' button may be largely ignored unless you wish to close that file, and open another.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you exit ApplePi without closing the file, no text will be lost.<BR><BR>
This is <i><u>very</u></i> unlike printing a PDF:</b>

<p style="margin-left: 0px">
<b>Case 3: 'Print a PDF</b>' was used:
<p style="margin-left: 20px">
Data representing dot-matrix graphics will be accumulated inside ApplePi.&nbsp; It will not be written to the PDF file until the '<b>Close Printer</b>' button is clicked.</p>
